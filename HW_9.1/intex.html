        <div class="text">This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand <br>
            head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but <br>
            the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening <br>
              bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their <br>
             course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.
            <br>
            <br>
           The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry,<br>
            remained in his seat,  and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way. <br>
           Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.
           <br>
           <br>
           "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I <br>
           should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive <br>
           into this herd of beasts!"</div>
           <div class="footer">The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.
